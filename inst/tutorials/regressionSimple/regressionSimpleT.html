<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to conduct simple regression analysis in R. Specifically we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use the <code>lm()</code> function to estimate a regression</li>
<li>How to use the <code>summary()</code> function to present the results of regression analysis</li>
<li>How to use the regression output to test hypotheses about the intercept and slope using the five-step hypothesis testing procedure</li>
<li>How to use the regression output to assess model fit</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="section-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>Regression</strong></span> is a tool for estimating the linear relationship between one or more independent variables measured at any level and an outcome variable measured at the interval level. We use regression to test hypotheses about the effect of independent variables on the outcome.</p>
<p>The <code>lm()</code> function in base R will estimate a linear regression model. We will illustrate how to use the <code>lm()</code> function to estimate a model, how to use the <code>summary()</code> function to produce a summary of the output, and we will practice interpreting results using several examples.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-example-1-vote-for-hillary-clinton-and-wage-growth" class="section level2">
<h2>Example 1: Vote for Hillary Clinton and Wage Growth</h2>
<p>Let’s say that we have posed the following question: Did wage growth in a county affect the share of the vote won by Hillary Clinton? We might make the argument that higher wage growth would lead voters to support the incumbent party candidate, Hillary Clinton, as voters would reward the Democratic president for improvements in their financial situation. By the same token, we might expect that lower wage growth (or declining wages) might lead them to support the challenger, Donald Trump. Thus we hypothesize:</p>
<p><span style="color:Chocolate">In a comparison of counties, those with higher wage growth will cast a higher percentage of the two-party vote share for Hillary Clinton than those counties with lower wage growth.</span></p>
<p>The <strong>counties</strong> data frame contains the variables <strong>wage_growth</strong>, which is the percent by which wages grew or fell in a county, and <strong>dem2p_percent</strong>, which is the percent of the two-party vote in the county that was cast for Hillary Clinton. To test our hypothesis, we will estimate a linear regression in which <strong>dem2p_percent</strong> is the dependent variable and <strong>wage_growth</strong> is the independent variable.</p>
<div id="section-estimate-a-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Estimate a Regression</h3>
<p>Running a regression in R is really quite simple! The function to run a regression is <code>lm()</code>. This stands for “linear model.” The function requires two arguments: a <code>formula</code> and <code>data</code>.</p>
<p>What is a <code>formula</code>? R’s <code>formula</code> specifies a relationship. It begins with the dependent variable and is followed by the tilde (~). The tilde in layman’s terms can be read as “depends on.” The formula ends with the explanatory variable (or variables, more in the next tutorial). So we specify <code>y~x</code>, where <code>y</code> is the dependent variable and <code>x</code> is the explanatory variable. This can be read as “<em>y</em> depends on <em>x</em>.”</p>
<p>Notice we don’t need <code>counties$</code> before the variable names, because we are using the <code>data</code> argument to tell R where the data is coming from. We are going to save the results as the object <em>My.first.model</em> and then use the <code>summary()</code> function to present the output.</p>

<div id="section-interpret-the-estimated-coefficients" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpret the Estimated Coefficients</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve found the estimated coefficients let’s determine what the model tells us about the relationship between <strong>wage_growth</strong> and <strong>dem2p_percent</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue">The intercept (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\alpha})\)</span></span> (conveniently labeled as such) is estimated to be 31.3521. Recall that the intercept is the expected value of the dependent variable when the explanatory variable has a value of zero. <span style="color:green"><em>The intercept tells us that if a county’s wage growth was flat (zero), we expect the county to cast 31.3521% of their vote for Hillary Clinton.</em></span> Note that because zero is a value of the independent variable that occurs in the data, its substantive interpretation is meaningful in this example.</p>
<p><span style="color:blue">The slope (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span>)</span> associated with the variable <strong>wage_growth</strong> is 0.45582. The positive slope indicates that higher wage growth was associated with a higher percentage of the vote for Hillary Clinton. Specifically the slope tells us the amount that our dependent variable (<strong>dem2p_percent</strong>) changes as our independent variable (<strong>wage_growth</strong>) increases by one unit (one percentage point). We can interpret this as follows: <span style="color:green"><em>For every additional percentage point growth in wages, on average, we expect counties to cast just under half a percentage point more votes for Hillary Clinton.</em></span></p>
</div>
<div id="section-calculating-predicted-values" class="section level3">
<h3>Calculating Predicted Values</h3>
<p>We can calculate the predicted vote share for Hillary Clinton in a county with the average value of wage_growth, which is 4.3 based on this regression as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{\textbf{dem2p_percent}} = \hat{\alpha}+ \hat{\beta}\textbf{wage_growth} = 31.3521+ 0.45582\times(4.3)=35.27218.\]</span></p>

<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-conduct-hypothesis-tests" class="section level3">
<h3>Conduct Hypothesis Tests</h3>
<p>Recall that our hypothesis test for <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta =0\)</span> is given by: <span class="math display">\[t=\frac{ \hat{\beta}- \beta_0}{SE(\hat{\beta})} = \frac{ \hat{\beta}}{SE(\hat{\beta})}\]</span></p>
<p>Columns 2-5 (under coefficients in the summary output above) present all the pieces needed to conduct and interpret the hypothesis test: each coefficient estimate, the standard error of each coefficient estimate, the associated <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test value, and the p-value associated with the hypothesis test that the coefficient is 0. (The same is true for hypothesis tests on the intercept, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.)</p>
<p>We will always specify a two-tailed alternative hypothesis that the coefficient is <strong>not</strong> equal to zero, even if our theoretical hypothesis is directional, as this is the standard practice.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-intercept" class="section level3">
<h3>The intercept</h3>
<p>Let’s test the null hypothesis that the intercept is zero against the alternative that it is not zero by walking through the five steps for hypothesis testing.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: State the null hypothesis</strong>. <span class="math inline">\(H:_0\alpha=0\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: State the alternative hypothesis</strong>. <span class="math inline">\(H:_A \alpha\ne0\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Compute the test statistic</strong>. R calculates the t-statistic for the estimated coefficients and reports it in the summary output.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div data-label="letter-heffalump" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="letter-heffalump-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>

<div id="letter-heffalump-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 4: Determine the p-value</strong>. The p-value is also reported in the output.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
<div data-label="letter-heffalump2" class="tutorial-question panel-body">
<div id="letter-heffalump2-answer_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="letter-heffalump2-message_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<div id="letter-heffalump2-action_button_container" class="shiny-html-output"></div>
<script>if (Tutorial.triggerMathJax) Tutorial.triggerMathJax()</script>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 5: Draw a conclusion</strong>. The intercept value has a large <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic and a very small p-value. We can thus reject the null hypothesis that the intercept is zero. Specifically, since p&lt;0.05, we can be 95% confident the intercept is not zero. In fact, it is &lt;0.00 so we are at least 99% confident the intercept is not zero. Similarly, the t-statistic is greater than the critical value of 1.96. This information also tells us that we can reject the null hypothesis.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-slope" class="section level3">
<h3>The slope</h3>
<p>Let’s walk through the hypothesis testing steps to test whether the slope coefficient is different from zero.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: State the null hypothesis</strong>. 1. <span class="math inline">\(H:_0\beta_{WG}=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: State the alternative hypothesis</strong>. <span class="math inline">\(H:_A \beta_{WG}\ne0\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Compute the test statistic</strong>. The t-statistic reported in the table is 7.431. Make sure you can find this in the output above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Determine the p-value</strong>. The p-value reported in the output is 1.39e-13. Again, make sure you can find this information in the output.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Draw a conclusion</strong>. The slope estimate has a large <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-statistic and a very small p-value. Here, too, we can reject the null hypothesis that the slope is zero. The evidence tells us that there is a statistically significant relationship between <strong>wage_growth</strong> and vote for Hillary Clinton.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-assess-model-fit" class="section level3">
<h3>Assess Model Fit</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by finding the value of <span style="color:blue"><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></span> and <span style="color:blue">the residual standard error</span>.</p>

<div id="section-r2" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:blue"><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></span>. The Multiple R-squared reported in the output tells us the proportion of the variance in the vote for Hillary Clinton that can be explained by all the variables in the model, which here is just <strong>wage_growth</strong>. The proportion of the variance explained by this model is 0.01746. Normally we present this as a percentage so that we say “1.746% of the variation in the percent of the two-party vote won by Hillary Clinton was explained by county wage growth.” Not very much! (We’ll talk about the Adjusted R-squared next week.)</p>
</div>
<div id="section-residual-standard-error" class="section level3">
<h3>Residual standard error</h3>
<p><span style="color:blue">Residual standard error.</span> The residual standard error is the standard deviation of the residuals. The residual standard error tells us the typical difference between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the model. In this example, the residual standard error is about 15.99 percentage points. Thus are preditions are off, on average, but about 16 points. Not so hot!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-example-2-vote-for-hillary-clinton-and-percent-black" class="section level2">
<h2>Example 2: Vote for Hillary Clinton and Percent Black</h2>
<p>The Democratic Party has consistently garnered more support from black voters than the Republican Party, considerably more. This leads to the following hypothesis:</p>
<p><span style="color:Chocolate">In a comparison of counties, those with higher percentages of blacks will cast a higher percentage of the two-party vote share for Hillary Clinton than those counties with lower percentages of blacks</span></p>
<div id="section-estimate-the-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Estimate the regression</h3>
<p>Still using the data frame <strong>counties</strong>, let’s estimate a simple regression to test this hypothesis. Model Hillary Clinton’s vote (<strong>dem2p_percent</strong>) as a function of the percent of a county that is Black (<strong>black_percent</strong>).</p>

The results provide all the information needed to interpret the substantive effect of the independent variable, to test hypotheses about the intercept and slope, to calculate the predicted value of the outcome variable for a particular value of the independent variable, and to assess the fit of the model.</p>
<p>You will become well-practiced in conducting and interpreting the results from regression analysis in future tutorials. For now, remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span style="color:blue">intercept</span> gives the value of the dependent variable, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, when the independent variable <span class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span>. The <span style="color:blue">slope</span> is the change in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> changes by 1 unit.</li>
<li>Anytime the value of the t-statistic for an estimated coefficient is greater than 1.96 in absolute value, the associated p-value will be less than 0.05, the confidence interval around the coefficient estimate will not include zero and we can reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero with 95% confidence. Conversely, if the t-statistic is smaller than 1.96, the p-value will be greater than 0.05, the confidence interval will include zero, and we cannot reject the null hypothesis. If we cannot reject the null hypothesis on the slope coefficient, we conclude that that independent variable does not have significant explanatory value, i.e., it does not contribute to our explanation of the outcome variable.</li>
<li><span style="color:blue"><span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span></span> gives the proportion of the variation in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> explained by the independent variables in the model. Bigger is better.</li>
<li>The <span style="color:blue">residual standard error</span> gives the standard deviation of the residuals. Because the empirical rule tells us 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation of the mean, the residual standard error can be interpreted as telling us that more than half of the errors in our model are within X – the value of the residual standard error – from the regression line (the mean of the residuals is always zero). Smaller is better as it means the data is clustered closer to the regression line.
